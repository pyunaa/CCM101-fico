TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

echo "Initiating automated backup..."

# Create the backup directory if it does not exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Compress the source directory into a tarball (.tar.gz)
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" "$SOURCE_DIR"

echo "Backup completed successfully at $TIMESTAMP!"
