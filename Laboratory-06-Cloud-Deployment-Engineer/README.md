# Mission Overview
Congratulations! Your flawless work in deploying data storage solutions has earned you a spot on the
Cloud Deployment Team at CloudNova Technologies.
Up until now, you have been deploying single containers (like a standalone web server or a storage
bucket). However, real-world enterprise applications are rarely just one container. They are "multi-tier" systems
that require a frontend web application communicating seamlessly with a backend database. Deploying these
one by one manually is prone to error.
Enter Docker Compose. In this mission, you will transition from manual commands to Infrastructure
as Code (IaC). Using a YAML configuration file, you will define a multi-container private cloud storage application
(Nextcloud and MariaDB) and deploy the entire stack simultaneously with a single command!
Remember: A junior engineer deploys servers by typing commands; a senior engineer deploys
infrastructure by writing code.

# Mission Objectives
At the end of this laboratory activity, you should be able to:
- Explain the concept of a multi-tier application architecture.
- Understand the purpose and structure of a docker-compose.yml file.
- Use a Linux command-line text editor (nano) to create configuration files.
- Deploy a multi-container application (Nextcloud + Database) using Docker Compose.
- Document deployment procedures and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using Markdown.
- Continue expanding your professional GitHub Cloud Computing Portfolio

# Commands Executed
```
mkdir nextcloud-deployment
cd nextcloud-deployment
nano docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs
docker-compose down
```

# Skills Learned

- Creating and editing YAML configuration files using nano.
- Deploying and managing multiple Docker containers.
- Understanding communication between application and database tiers.
